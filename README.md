## Sports Connect (Twitter Inspired Social Media Platform)

Sports Connect is a twitter inspired, social media platform. Users will have the ability to create a profile and post different things (similar to tweets on twitter). There will be a hashtag assigned to each tweet, which will make it convenient for users to filter through different discussions of their interest. The application itself will have the general features accessible within the actual Twitter platform.

Sports Connect is currently under development. Feel free to check back later for the live version!

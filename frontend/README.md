## Sports Talk (Social Media Platform)

Sports Talk is a twitter inspired, social media platform. Users will have the ability to create a profile and post different "twits" pertaining to different sports events and outcomes. There will be a hashtag assigned to each tweet, which will make it convenient for users to filter through different "twits", only displaying the specific sport of choice (MLB, NBA, NFL, etc)

This full stack application will be built using React and JavaScript within the front-end, while the backend configuring will consist of MySQL, Node, and Express.

Sports Talk is currently within the creation process. Feel free to check back later for the live version!

## Languages Used

Front End: React, Typescript, Styled Components, Axios
Back End: Node, Express, MySQL, Sequelize, JWT Authentication
